# jPerf
Windows performance recorder

## What is it?
jPerf is a tool for determining how much load your computer is under over a period of time. Useful for seeing how many of your system resources are being used by a process or application, and where bottlenecks may be. 

Currently, jPerf can monitor CPU load, GPU load and RAM usage.

jPerf also has the ability to place markers through a performance recording by clicking the Marker button. This can help you keep track of what is going on during your recording.
